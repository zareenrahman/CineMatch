# CineMatch
CineMatch is an interactive, movie recommendation system built with Python and Streamlit, using the MovieLens dataset. It automatically downloads movie rating data, computes item-to-item similarity via cosine similarity and Pearson correlation, and lets users search for any movie, view its details, and get instant personalized recommendations.
